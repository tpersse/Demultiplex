the main ideas:
import bioinfo module, any other modules needed

open files (R1, I1, I2, R2) for reading
go read by read through Index 1, looking first at quality scores of indices
if the indices are low score (below threshold of Q20), send corresponding read lines to low score files per each read file
if the scores aren't below threshold, then, determine whether corresponding index in I2 is the reverse complement of I1
	if it is, then add each corresponding read from R1 and R2 to the file corresponding to the barcode
	if it isn't, add each corresponding read from R1 and R2 to the index-hopped file

for single-nucleotide correction (only one N, might not actually do this... if done, will go below low score section.)
if there is a single N in the index (in both I1 and I2 combined)...
	take the index with an N, determine the position of the N
	take the length of the index, then subtract the value of N (this gives the position of the reverse complement in the other index)
	using this new position, find the corresponding nucleotide in I2, then take this position's reverse complement (this is the nucleotide that is missing)
	finally, take this nt and plug it into I1 to remove single N
